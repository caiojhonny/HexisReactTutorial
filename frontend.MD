## Hexis Technology Hub | Front-End Challenge

Hi :) How are you ? This is our little test, here you need to develop a client side application to get the most popular repositories from a GitHub user.

This application must run on the modern browsers and follow the mobile first concepts and
have a responsiveness behaviour

**API**: [https://developer.github.com/v3/](https://developer.github.com/v3/)

### **When you must score points with us:** ###
Like a regular user we want to, without errors and/or bad treated interceptions: 
* Search for a GitHub user;
* See the searched GitHub user details and repos;
* Sort the results by order (DESC; ASC) and popularity;
* See a repository details;

### **How I know that I've done?** ###

* You should have at least one screen with a searchbox to type for a user;
* The search must return a detail page (Navigation and UX is by your own ;))
* I can navigate between repositories and change/research users;
* The layout is responsive and fits well even in mobile;

  **Frameworks and libs aren't pre requisites but we use React, [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/);**
DETAIL: Feel free to develop in other options like [Angular](https://angular.io/) or [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) 
or nothing, your choice, give us your best :);
* A routing system is extremaly required;

### **Avaliation** ###

* Project organization (Folder, Architecture and project structure, documentation and versioning);
* Innovative ideas. We inspire creativity, the use of recent technologies and new patterns, get solid arguments 
and lets talk!
* Good practices (Security, organization and consistence for large scale applications);
* Well wrote and stable code;

PLUS: Automated and/or integration tests

The perfomance, resources utilization and network handling will be avaliated during the entire process.

### **Complementation** ###
API Reference:
* User details: [https://api.github.com/users/{username}](https://api.github.com/users/{username})
* User repositories: [https://api.github.com/users/{username}/repos](https://api.github.com/users/{username}/repos)
* Repository details: [https://api.github.com/repos/{full_name}](https://api.github.com/repos/{full_name})


### **Send to us!** ###
The challenge must be delivered by [GitHub](http://github.com/) private or public your choice, just invite us or send us your repository link :)!. 

The application should be hosted (We want to see online! :) Check some free providers: ([Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/), [Plunker](https://plnkr.co/)).

We are here for any doubts!

Good work and success!
